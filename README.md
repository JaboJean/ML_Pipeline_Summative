# üìà Gold Stock Price Prediction ‚Äî ML & Deep Learning

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates how to **predict gold stock prices** using both **traditional machine learning** and **deep learning** techniques. The project was developed as part of the *Introduction to Machine Learning* module.

---

## üß† Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and compare multiple regression models to forecast **daily closing prices of gold stocks**. The notebook includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of results and learning behavior

The main question addressed:
> *Can deep learning models outperform traditional machine learning models in predicting gold stock prices?*

## üõ†Ô∏è Models Used

- **Traditional ML:** Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVR  
- **Deep Learning:** Feedforward Neural Network (Keras/TensorFlow)

---

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- R¬≤ Score  

The notebook also includes visualizations such as:
- Learning curves
- Loss curves (for the deep model)
- Residual plots

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Open the notebook `Intro_to_ML_Summative.ipynb` in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kcATkUWZPgOfz1C2TQSrLkb6drZO1UTp#scrollTo=LN1FXiaQZ_u7) or Jupyter.  
2. Upload the dataset (`goldstock_v2.csv`) if prompted.  
3. Run all cells sequentially to:
   - Preprocess data  
   - Train models  
   - Evaluate performance and visualize results.
